This project was created in April 2024, as a unique method of demonstrating the proposed solutions related to wakening a driver while using autonomous driving features on a vehicle.

This was created in conjunction with an academic paper for the class AP Research on risks of autonomous vehicles and possible solutions to ensure a safer driving experience that place more agency on the driver to maintain control of the vehicle when autonomous features are activated. 

This project was shown to multiple classrooms to collect information on how many students a specific solution. 

Developed with the usage of the Godot game engine, its compile methods were used to turn my project into a web application.
